# Manager

## Overview
The main purpose of this app is to build a complex app using Redux and Navigation bar.

## Covered Skills
- Navigation
- Redux
- Authentication

## What I Learned
### Login Flow with Redux

User types something

-> Call Action Creator with the text

-> Action Creator returns an action

-> Action sent to all reducers

-> Reducer calculates new app state

-> State sent to all components

-> Components re-render with new state

### Tips to use when I code
- types.js: Contains const of action.type names to avoid typos
